## Starting the application
To start the application, you can use the built-in Laravel development server

```shell
php artisan serve
```
or you can directly use PHP built-in server
```shell
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```

or if you choose to use Laravel Valet, run the command below to have it available at [http://cavu.test](http://cavu.test)
```shell
valet link
```
or if you wish to test locally  with SSL, run the command below to have it available  at [https://cavu.test](https://cavu.test)
```shell
valet secure
```
## Running Tests
To run the tests for the application, you can use either of the following commands
```shell
php artisan test
```
or use 
```shell
vendon/bin/phpunit
```

Make sure to run these commands from the root folder of the application. The tests will help ensure that the application functions as expected and that any changes made in the future do not introduce regressions.
